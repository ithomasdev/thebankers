To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.

- cd barcode_scanner
- npm run android
- npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
- npm run web


New standards for expo -- When you do an npm install in the project, expo will install (I THINK)

npx expo start
